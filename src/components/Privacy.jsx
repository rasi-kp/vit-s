                                a) When you use the Platform, we gather and keep the personal data that
                                you voluntarily submit on occasion. Our main objective is to give you a
                                secure, effective, seamless, and personalized experience. This enables us

                                will most likely satisfy them. This will make your experience safer and

                                our services. We don't gather delicate personal data like biometric data,

                                personal information. We try to make it clear which fields are necessary
                                and which ones are optional. You may choose not to utilize a certain
                                service or feature on the Platform if you do not want to disclose
                                information. To use the Services, however, you must first create a

                                advertising campaigns, and advance confidence and safety, we employ data
                                gathering tools like "log data" and "cookies" on specific sites and in
                                specific areas of the Platform. The information or data that your browser
                                delivers to us as "Log Data" and the "Cookies" that are stored on your
                                computer's hard drive to help us provide our services are different. We
                                provide some services that can only be accessed by using a "cookie."
                                Additionally, we employ cookies so that you have to input your password
                                less frequently while logged in. Additionally, cookies might assist us in
                                delivering content that is customized to your interests. The majority of
                                cookies are "session cookies," which means that they are removed from your
                                hard drive at the conclusion of a session. If your browser allows it, you
                                may always choose to reject our cookies, but doing so may prevent you from
                                using some features of the Platform and force you to input your password
                                more frequently when logged in.
                                <br />

                                d) In addition, there is a chance that third-party "cookies" or other
                                similar technologies will appear on some Platform sites. Third-party
                                cookies are used by them; we have no control over them.

                                our message boards or offer comments. As allowed by law, we keep your
                                information as long as it's required to resolve disputes, offer customer
                                assistance, and troubleshoot issues.

                                f) We may compile information about you into a file if you send us
                                personal communication, such as emails or letters, or if other users or
                                third parties provide us correspondence regarding your activity in
                                relation to the Platform.

                                identifying data about them. Non-personal identification information may
                                include the name of the user's browser, the type of computer they are
                                using, and technical information about their means of connection to our
                                Site, including the browser type, the Internet service provider used, and
                                other similar information, like the Media Access Control (MAC) address,
                                screen resolution, operating system version, and type and version of their
                                internet browser. It may also include the date and time the user first
                                accessed the Platform or any of its components. If you visit the Platform
                                using a mobile device, we may collect comparable data, such as the kind
                                and identity of your device.

                                h) By using the Platform or by giving us your consent (where required by
                                law), you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of
                                your country of residence, which may have different data protection laws
                                than in your country. Your personal information may be stored and
                                processed in any country where we have facilities or service providers.

                                anything that, in our sole discretion, we believe might be potentially
                                dangerous, provocative, or humiliating to our Users, to be uploaded,
                                published, or put on the Platform or website. In order to ensure their
                                online and Platform safety, users should keep the following in mind.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                a) Password security is the exclusive responsibility of the user. Nobody
                                in charge at SavvyPool will know your password. You should take
                                precautions to prevent unauthorised access to your password, computer, and

                                account or password. SavvyPool must be notified right away if you believe
                                there has been any unauthorized use of your account by sending an email to{" "}

                                b) Each User is liable for the security of their personal data. Users are
                                strongly advised from posting their home addresses, email addresses, phone
                                numbers, or other personally identifiable information online for public
                                use.

                                c) All Users should be aware that any images they publish to the Platform
                                may be downloaded as anybody with access to a computer screen has the
                                ability to save any image they see. Technically, there is no way to stop
                                this, hence SavvyPool is not accountable in these situations. Please do
                                not post your photographs if you are concerned about someone else viewing
                                or storing them. You may, at your option, send our business partner a
                                photo directly, and not through the Platform, if they request one as part
                                of any contact between you and the partner.

                                d) Do not advertise pyramid schemes, distribute chain letters, or solicit
                                users to work for any network marketing or multilevel marketing companies.

                                legal guardians, we never intentionally collect personally identifiable
                                information from children or other users under the age of 18. If we learn
                                that a child under the age of 18 has given us personal information, we
                                will promptly tell them and ask them to either get their parent's or legal
                                guardian's permission or remove the information. After the predetermined
                                amount of time, we remove the data from our servers if the user disregards
                                the instruction. Please get in touch with us if you're a parent or
                                guardian and you know that your child has given us personal information so
                                that we can take the appropriate measures.
